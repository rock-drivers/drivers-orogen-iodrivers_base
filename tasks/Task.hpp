    /** Generic integration of an iodrivers_base::Driver in oroGen
     *
     * configureHook: Subclasses must call setDriver with a valid driver object
     * before calling the base task's configureHook. Any I/O must be done after
     * the base configureHook is done. If the _io_port property is not empty,
     * the subclass must open the URI itself. Otherwise, the base configureHook
     * will tie the task's io_raw_in and io_raw_out ports to the device. Additionally,
     * in order to easily guarantee an acceptable level of exception-safety, one
     * should use the scope guard ConfigureGuard provided with this package.
     *
     * <code>
     * bool Task::configureHook()
     * {
     *   iodrivers_base::ConfigureGuard guard(this);
     *   std::auto_ptr<MyDriver> driver(new MyDriver);
     *   if (!_io_port.get().empty())
     *     driver->openURI(_io_port.get());
     *   setDriver(driver.release());
     *
     *   if (!TaskBase::configureHook())
     *     return false;
     *
     *   // Do device initialization here. NEVER before
     *   // TaskBase::configureHook has been called
     *   // Also, don't forget to release the guard by
     *   // calling commit() on it just before returning.
     *   guard.commit();
     *   return true;
     * }
     * </code>
     *
     * cleanupHook: the base implementation closes the device. Perform device
     * de-initialization before calling the base cleanupHook.
     *
     * processIO: called when the task is called because of I/O has been
     * received. It will be called as long as there are valid packets buffered,
     * so processIO must ensure that all available packets have been read.
     *
     * <h2>Device ownership</h2>
     *
     * The device object is owned by the subclass, which is responsible for its
     * destruction. setDriver may be called more than once with the same device
     * (so, it's OK to allocate the device as an attribute instead of allocating
     * on the heap).
     *
     * Calling setDriver adds connections between the driver and task ports. If
     * this connection must be removed (to get a "detached" device), one must
     * call detachDriver() after having called setDriver. Note that one does not
     * need to do so before the driver is deleted. Calling detachDriver after
     * having deleted the driver, though, will lead to a use-after-free.
